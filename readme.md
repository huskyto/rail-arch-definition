# Rail Architecture

Welcome to the `Rail Architecture` repository!

This project originated as a simple 8-bit architecture designed for the game `Turing Complete`. It has since expanded to include a variety of tools and resources that we hope will be helpful to those interested in learning more about the architecture, its assembly language programming, or simply looking for a fun coding challenge.

## Contents

1. **[Architecture Definition](rail-arch-definition.md):** This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Rail Architecture, detailing its structure, operational codes, systems, and registers. It's an excellent place to start to get a grasp of how the architecture works.

2. **[Assembly Language Definition](rail-arch-asm.md):** Here, you'll find the specifics of the assembly language designed for the Rail architecture. This document includes a comprehensive list of commands and their corresponding operational codes, along with examples and usage notes. You can also take a look at the [ASM Version 2](rail-arch-asm-v2.md).

3. **Simulators:** There are two simulators available to allow you to experiment with the Rail architecture and run code crafted for it:

   - **[Rust Simulator](https://github.com/huskyto/rail-arch-rust):** A fast and efficient simulator written in Rust. This simulator includes an assembler, allowing you to compile and run your code right away. (Recommended)

   - **[Kotlin Simulator](https://github.com/huskyto/rail-arch-kt):** A versatile simulator written in Kotlin. This simulator also includes an assembler, and its JVM-based nature makes it run on a wide variety of platforms.

4. **[ASM Examples](asm-examples/):** Some simple ASM examples to get a better feel of how the architecture and the ASM works.

5. **[Ingame architecture](ingame-arch.jpg):** A screenshot of the architecture ingame is currently included.
The save of the architecture itself will be added at a later time, so code can be run there as well, if you wish to do so.

## Future Plans

There are plans to bring this architecture to life on an FPGA. However, this is quite a big endeavor, so it might be some time before it becomes a reality. We'll keep you updated on our progress.

## Contributing

Feedback and suggestions are welcome on all aspects of the Rail architecture, its assembly language, and the associated simulators. If you have ideas, improvements, or questions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
